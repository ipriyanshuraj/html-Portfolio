<h1>The Best Movies According to Priyanshu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The lord of the rings</h3>
<p>At its heart, however, The Lord of the Rings movies are about bravery and friendship. Frodo and his best friend Sam (Sean Astin) are far from the biggest or strongest characters in the land, but they show time and again that courage can come from the unlikeliest of places</p>
<h3>Lucy</h3>
<p>Scarlett is a star, and her presence [in the film] made it a lot more appealing for women." Michael Bodey of The Australian commented that women having comprised half the audience is "a seemingly new precedent for an action film" and that, because of its box office performance, Lucy is the film out of all of Besson's</p>
<h3>Pirates of carribbean</h3>
<p>The cinematic importance of this film introduces some major archetypal concepts, like the Captain Jack Sparrow and the classic runaway love duo being Will and Elizabeth. It's also one of the most famous pirate films of all time.</p>
